## What is Galileo Offline Maps? {#whatIsGalileoOffllineMaps}

[Galileo Offline Maps](https://galileo-app.com) is a handy travel solution for offline browsing and [searching](02-features.md#search) the up-to-date map wherever you go. [Mark the places](02-features.md#bookmarks) and [record your trips](02-features.md#GPSTracks) easily in one tap and [organize your geodata into collections](02-features.md#collections) to easily access them later.

If you use more than one iOS/Android device, the Galileo app will securely [sync all your data across multiple devices](03-settings.md#sync). There is also a [backup feature](03-settings.md#dataBackup) to make a copy of your information.

Use your device to [find the shortest routes](02-features.md#navigation) between multiple stops and get turn-by-turn directions with Bluetooth capable voice guidance.
