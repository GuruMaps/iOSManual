## App permissions {#appPermissions}

### User location {#userLocation}

_Where Am I?
Let the app know your location to show it on the map ans record GPS tracks._


Message asking to access Location Services data. This is a standard request for permission that is generated by all programs that use location services information. Choose one of these options:

* Tapping **Allow While Using App** or **Allow Once** will give the app permission to use Location Services to determine your current location on a map if needed \(highly recommended\).
* Tapping **Don't Allow** will prevent the App from accessing your location.

Location-based information within the app might be unavailable, inaccurate, or incomplete unless you turn on Location Services. Location Services uses GPS and Bluetooth (where they're available), along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspots and cellular towers to determine the approximate location of your device.

**How to turn Location Services ON or OFF for Guru Maps:**

1. Go to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location Services. 
2. Make sure that Location Services is ON.
3. Scroll down to find the Guru Maps app.
4. Select an option: Never, Ask Next Time, While Using the App or Always.



### Notifications {#Notifications}

The app will also request permission to send you push notifications with the following system dialog. Tap **Allow** to be notified when new map updates are available.

## Download a Map {#MapDownload}

When you allow the Guru Maps to use your location, the app will ask you to download the **map for your region** when launching it for the first time.

Other regions will be available for download while browsing and zooming directly on the map or from the app settings at **Download Maps** menu:

## Navigating a Map {#NavigatingAMap}

There are standard and well-known options such as tap, drag and pinch which are used to interact with the App.  
To **move the map**, drag it with your finger in the direction you want to position the map:

<img src="/assets/finger-moving.png" width="53" height="84" />

To **zoom in**, use double tap or spread your fingers apart:

<img src="/assets/double-tap.png" width="53" height="84" /> <img src="/assets/expanding.png" width="75" height="83" />

To **zoom out**, tap with two fingers or pinch your fingers together:

<img src="/assets/two-finger-tap.png" width="58" height="84" /> <img src="/assets/reducing-size.png" width="71" height="84" />

To **zoom in/out with only one finger**, double-tap the map, hold the second tap and drag your finger up or down.

To **zoom using on-map +/- buttons**, go to the app setting [Show Zoom Buttons](/03-settings.md#appearance) to enable them.

To **rotate the map**, hold the map with two fingers and drag them simultaneously in a circular motion. A compass icon will appear which you can tap to return the map to north-up:

Tap the map and hold to bring up the pop-up with available options \(from left to right\):

* Bookmark this location, 
* Mark your current location,  
* Create route and directions to this location.

To measure the straight line distance between two points “as the crow flies”, tap your starting and destination points simultaneously with your fingers on the map and hold to trace the path. A dashed line will appear on the map between the two locations, and the estimated distance will then be displayed:

# Interface Overview {#interfaceOverview}

## Application Modes {#applicationModes}

### Location button {#locationButton}

The app works in multiple modes depending on the number of taps on the _Location_ button with the following sign ![](/assets/icon_gps.png). Your position is shown on the map as a blue marker where you are currently position and as a blue arrow when you are moving:

<img src="/assets/map_location.png" width="250" height="250" /> !<img src="/assets/map_driving.png" width="250" height="250" />

**Tip**: if your location cannot be determined precisely, a blue circle also appears around the location marker. The size of the circle depends on how accurately your location can be determined: the smaller the circle – the greater the accuracy.

### Tracking mode {#trackingMode}

To determine your current approximate location on the map and enable the **tracking mode**, tap once the _Location_ button:

![](/assets/icon_gps.png) → ![](/assets/icon_gps_act.png)

Once tracking mode is active, the App tracks your position on the map as you move. To exit the tracking mode, move the map.

### Driving mode {#drivingMode}

To enable the **driving mode**, double tap the _Location_ button:

![](/assets/icon_gps.png) → ![](/assets/icon_gps_act.png) → ![](/assets/icon_compas.png)

While in driving mode, the app will orient the map in the direction you are currently moving. If you stop moving, the map will be oriented to the north.

**Note**: the accuracy of the compass can be affected by magnetic or environmental interference \(e.g. the magnets in earbuds\) and the compass may need to be calibrated from time to time. When the device displays the calibration alert, rotate the screen to move the red ball around in a circle.

### Location services {#locationServices}

Every time you see this icon ![](/assets/icon_question.png), it means that your GPS cannot currently get accurate information about your location. It may also appear when Location Services is disabled on your device.

Enable Location Services on your device and give your permission to the Guru Maps app to determine your location in system Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location Services.

**Note**: depending on your device and available services, Location Services uses a combination of cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS to determine your location. If you're not within a clear line of sight to GPS satellites, your device will automatically determine your location using crowd-sourced Wi-Fi and cell tower locations or even iBeacons any of which are in range \(these may vary in availability in more remote areas\).

## Trip Computer {#tripComputer}

The trip computer panel provides you all the necessary trip statistics while moving. If enabled, it will display such useful information as \(from left to right\):

<img src="/assets/trip_monitor_1.png" width="375" height="56" />

* current speed
* altitude

While recording a GPS track it will additionally display \(from left to right\):

<img src="/assets/trip_monitor_2.png" width="375" height="114" />

* distance traveled
* trip duration

To hide the trip computer panel from map view, go to app Settings &gt; Show Trip Computer.
